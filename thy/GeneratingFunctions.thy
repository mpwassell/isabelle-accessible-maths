text \<open>A die is thrown 10 times, what is the probability that the sum of the scores is 27\<close>

(* Generalise this to: Have IID uniform variables over finite natural set. Study the 
sum of the these.
If n is the number of throws then

P ( Sum 0 n X_i = k ) = sum over all possible ways of making k out of n natural numbers. Repeats allowed *)
